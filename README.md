# TapOn
An all purpose app for women's menstrual health. It has a cycle tracker, 
and a peer to peer system only accessible for women where women can seek help from other women around them. 
It uses a gender detection python script which uses Machine Learning to verify that only a women is logging in.

# Usability
Due to the massive size of the gender_detection software all of it couldnt be added, so only the main detecting file has been added to give a reference to the code written. 
Due to the massive size of the App, We are adding a drive link to download the zip file for the app- 

# Contributers
This is a team effort from building the main app, to using the gender detection model and building a landing page for the app.
